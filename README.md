# CLOUD: Float your life story up in the sky
This project is an XCode application on iOS software that functions as a calendar. The calendar does the work as usual calendar apps, but includes extra functions: basic mode, student mode, and life mode. In student mode, I can set a class timetable, set deadlines and events, make a to-do list, and write down the achievements. In life mode, I can set events, make entertainment calendar with photos, write down rising hour and bedtime. Basic mode is the basic calendar, which shows whole events and deadlines set in student and life mode. In general, the software can change its theme and language.
